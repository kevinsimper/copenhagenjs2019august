<div style="font-size: 28px;">So before we find out who's the winner, we do a small game such as this: each row of audience from left handside, tell the audience to his/her right a little about himself and a number as well. The number should be a number he received from the previous person add his own age, or only his own age if he's the first person. When the number passed to the rightmost person, this person should then tell the person behind him. The bottom right person should then have the sum total. Rule is try to be sincere about the age, but overall, the most closest number we got from the form is the winner</div>
